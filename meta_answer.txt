Comparing and contrasting the outcomes of COP26, COP27, and COP28, we observe a consistent recognition of the urgency of climate action coupled with a reiteration of the need to meet the Paris Agreement goals. All three COP summits underscored the commitment to limit global warming, particularly to pursue efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5Â°C. Each summit highlighted the importance of rapid and meaningful action across several key areas: mitigation, adaptation, and finance.

At COP26, the Glasgow Climate Pact placed a strong emphasis on the critical decade leading to 2030, calling for significant emissions reductions and increased financial support for adaptation in developing countries. One distinguishing feature was its explicit invitation for parties to update their NDCs, and it also established a dialogue on funding for loss and damage due to climate impacts, a theme that would echo in the subsequent COPs.

COP27's outcomes, encapsulated in the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, affirmed previous agreements and pushed for comprehensive responses to intersecting global crises. The plan was notable for its attention to the socioeconomic implications of climate action, stressing a just and inclusive approach. There was a strong push for investment in low-carbon transformations and special emphasis on fulfilling financial commitments, specifically the unmet $100 billion per year target to support climate action in developing countries. The focus on loss and damage was again highlighted, marking a continuity from COP26.

Moving to COP28, the outcomes of the first global stocktake were at the forefront, stressing that more profound actions are necessary to keep within the Paris Agreement's temperature thresholds. Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber's proposal spoke strongly to the escalating impacts of climate change and the warmest year on record, pushing for a heightening of global efforts. Notable was the mention of a just transition away from fossil fuels, phasing down of unabated coal, and the necessity for clean energy investment. Emphasis continued on the need for finance, capacity building, and technology transfer, but with much insistence on updating and enhancing climate actions to align closer with the scientific findings and equitable considerations.

Each summit built on the momentum of the last, with consistent calls for increased ambition and tangible actions. There was a clear through-line on themes such as the importance of financing and engaging all stakeholders, including vulnerable populations and non-state actors. However, there was a discernible shift from setting targets and inviting nation states to submit stronger NDCs at COP26 towards more focused discussions on implementation, financial obligations, and addressing loss and damage at COP27, and finally, a stronger push for an immediate and robust upscaling of efforts at COP28 in response to the pressing evidence of climate impact and the need for a fair transition to a sustainable future.
