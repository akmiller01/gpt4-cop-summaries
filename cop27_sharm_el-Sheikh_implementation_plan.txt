developing countries, with such flows in 2019–2020 estimated to be USD 803 billion,
23
which is 31–32 per cent of the annual investment needed to keep the global temperature rise
well below 2 °C or at 1.5 °C, and also below what would be expected in the light of the
investment opportunities identified and the cost of failure to meet climate stabilization
targets;
36. Urges developed country Parties to provide enhanced support, including through
financial resources, technology transfer and capacity-building, to assist developing country
Parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation, in continuation of their existing
obligations under the Convention, and encourages other Parties to provide or continue to
provide such support voluntarily;
37. Calls on the shareholders of multilateral development banks and international
financial institutions to reform multilateral development bank practices and priorities, align
and scale up funding, ensure simplified access and mobilize climate finance from various
sources and encourages multilateral development banks to define a new vision and
commensurate operational model, channels and instruments that are fit for the purpose of
adequately addressing the global climate emergency, including deploying a full suite of
instruments, from grants to guarantees and non-debt instruments, taking into account debt
burdens, and to address risk appetite, with a view to substantially increasing climate finance;
38. Calls on multilateral development banks to contribute to significantly increasing
climate ambition using the breadth of their policy and financial instruments for greater
results, including on private capital mobilization, and to ensure higher financial efficiency
and maximize use of existing concessional and risk capital vehicles to drive innovation and
accelerate impact;
39. Emphasizes the ongoing challenges faced by many developing country Parties in
accessing climate finance and encourages further efforts, including by the operating entities
of the Financial Mechanism, to simplify access to such finance;
40. Takes note of the report on the determination of the needs of developing country
Parties related to implementing the Convention and the Paris Agreement and in this context
