The central theme of Dr. Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber's proposal for COP28 revolves around the outcomes of the first global stocktake, reassessing the collective progress towards the Paris Agreement's objectives, and the urgent need for enhanced climate action. The proposal highlights the importance of adhering to the Paris Agreement's goals of limiting global temperature rise, emphasizing that despite various mitigation and adaptation efforts, the collective actions of parties are insufficient to meet these goals. The proposal voices serious concern about the accelerating impacts of climate change, the likelihood of 2023 being the warmest year on record, and underscores the urgent need for action and support to maintain the possibility of limiting temperature rise to 1.5°C.

The text reinforces the Paris Agreement's emphasis on equity, common but differentiated responsibilities, and varied national circumstances. It acknowledges the multifaceted nature of the climate crisis, stressing its impact on human rights, ecosystems, biodiversity, food security, and the right to health, among others. Dr. Al Jaber’s draft calls for accelerating renewables, phasing down unabated coal power, investing in clean energy, and ensuring a just transition away from fossil fuels. It also points out the critical need for financing, capacity-building, and technology transfer as vital enablers of climate action, and recognizes the importance of international cooperation in tackling global issues, including climate change. The proposal urges parties to update and enhance their actions and support to reflect their ambitions in line with scientific findings and equity. The significant role of social dialogue and participation of all stakeholders, including Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and youth, in creating sustainable solutions is also emphasized.
