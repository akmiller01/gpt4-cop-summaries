The Glasgow Climate Pact, adopted at COP26, reaffirms the international community's commitment to the Paris Agreement goals, reiterating the critical need for rapid action to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It recognizes the importance of science in policy-making, noting with concern that human activities have already led to 1.1°C of warming with significant impacts being observed globally. The pact places urgency on enhancing action across three main areas: mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, adaptation to climate impacts, and mobilization of finance, with a focus on increased support and capacity-building for developing nations.

Key elements of the pact include the need for significant emissions reductions by 2030, the integration of adaptation into planning, and at least doubling financial support for adaptation in developing countries by 2025. It invites parties to update their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to be consistent with the 1.5°C target. The pact also emphasizes the importance of finance, technology transfer, and capacity-building for both mitigation and adaptation, noting that the goal of mobilizing $100 billion annually for climate action in developing nations has not been met. It supports the role of stakeholders such as indigenous peoples, local communities, and civil society in climate action. Additionally, loss and damage due to climate change are recognized, with the pact urging support for those particularly vulnerable, and establishing a dialogue on funding for these issues. Lastly, the pact encourages collaboration among countries and between various actors to close the gaps in implementation, calling for world leaders to convene in 2023 to consider increased ambition.
